			<h2>Independent micro-libraries. Greater than the sum of their parts</h2>
		</header>

		<article>
			<p>A small collection of micro-libraries that can be used on their own or together. Each library is totally independent and has no dependencies. Currently includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>exemplar.js - provides sugar for declaring function exemplars (i.e. making use of the function + prototype pattern), inheriting and copying properties across.</li>
				<li>events.js - provides an event emitter/pub-sub library that supports DOM and non-DOM events and supports rudimentary namespacing.</li>
				<li>attr.js - provides two functions: attr.get and attr.set that allow easy access to attributes nested inside object without having to check if each sub-attribute exists.</li>
				<li>fp.js - provides a selection of functional programming style functions, leaving out those normally provided by such libraries that are already in ES5 arrays.</li>
				<li>domb.js - provides a JS object &rarr; DOM element binding function to auto-update the DOM on JS object changes.</li>
			</ul>
